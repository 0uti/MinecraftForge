This is Forge Mod Loader, or FML for short, by cpw.

It is a clean reimplementation of a mod loading system for server side use,
incorporating API implementations of client side ModLoader by Risugami.

It can be installed on its own, or as part of Minecraft Forge.

If you have downloaded the server zip file you can install it as follows:
Installation
============
To install this on it's own into a minecraft server, simply copy the contents
of the fml server zip file into the minecraft_server.jar file.

Forge Installation
==================
This code also ships as a part of Minecraft Forge. You do not need to install it
separately from your Minecraft Forge installation.

If you have downloaded the source code pack, you can install it as follows:

Standalone source installation
==============================

To install this source code for development purposes, extract this zip file 
into an mcp installation containing vanilla jars only. It should create a new
folder "fml" inside that installation.

Once extracted, run the install.sh or install.bat script provided from the fml
directory. It should decompile and patch your MCP source code for the server.

Forge source installation
=========================
MinecraftForge should ship with this code and install it as part of the forge
installation process, no further action should be required on your part.


For reference this is version @MAJOR@.@MINOR@.@REV@.@BUILD@ of FML
for Minecraft version @MCVERSION@.
